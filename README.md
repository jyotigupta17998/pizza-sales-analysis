# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes transactional sales data from a pizza store to uncover **key business insights, trends, and KPIs**.  
The goal is to help management make informed decisions on **sales, marketing, inventory, and operations**.  

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Calculate overall **Revenue, Total Pizzas Sold, and Total Orders**.  
- Analyze **sales distribution** by category, size, and type.  
- Identify **best-selling & least-selling pizzas**.  
- Study **time-based sales trends** (daily, monthly, hourly).  
- Compute **KPIs** like Average Order Value (AOV) & Average Pizza per Order.  
- Build **visualization dashboards** for decision-making.  

## 📂 Dataset
**File:** `pizza_sales.csv`  
**Key Fields:**  
- `order_id` → Unique identifier for each order  
- `pizza_id` → Unique identifier for each pizza  
- `pizza_name` → Pizza sold  
- `quantity` → Number of pizzas sold  
- `total_price` → Transaction revenue  
- `date`, `time` → Order timestamp  
- `pizza_category`, `pizza_size` → Classification attributes  

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Revenue** = Sum of total_price  
- **Total Pizzas Sold** = Sum of quantity  
- **Total Orders** = Count of unique order_id  
- **Average Order Value (AOV)** = Total Revenue ÷ Total Orders  
- **Average Pizzas per Order** = Total Pizzas Sold ÷ Total Orders  

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
- **Daily Trend** → Sales by day of the week  
- **Hourly Trend** → Sales by hour of the day  
- **Monthly Trend** → Revenue & orders trend  
- **% Sales by Category & Size** → Customer preferences & inventory planning  
- **Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas** → Menu & promotions strategy  
- **Bottom 5 Least-Selling Pizzas** → Optimization opportunities  

## 💡 Business Insights
- Classic pizzas dominate sales, Veggie pizzas have lower demand.  
- Large pizzas contribute the most revenue.  
- Peak sales occur during weekends & summer months.  
- Some pizzas show consistently poor performance → can be redesigned or removed.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- **CSV Dataset** (pizza_sales.csv)  

## 📑 Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis  
- Visualizations (bar charts, line charts, trend charts)  
- Business Requirements Document (BRD)  
- Insights & recommendations  

## ✅ Conclusion & Recommendations
- Focus marketing on **high-performing categories**.  
- Optimize menu by reconsidering **least-selling pizzas**.
